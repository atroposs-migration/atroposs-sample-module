# How to create an Atroposs module

> # Note: This is deprecated starting January 2024. Please use the main [README.md](https://github.com/PRODYNA/atroposs-sample-module/blob/main/README.md) and use the described steps there.

This instructions explain how you can setup an angular module project for Atroposs from scratch.

  <br>
  This step-by-step manual guides you through the steps, to build a Atroposs-module (Angular-library).
  The module can be published to [npmjs.org](npmjs.org) and then be imported into Angular applications.

> Note: If you want to publish to npmjs.org you need an account (it's free :)

## üìùWhat you need

- [Angular](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local)
  > Note: Please use Angular version 13.x.x or 14.x.x ‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó
- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) / [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable)
- Editor (e.g. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
- [git](https://git-scm.com/) & [github](https://github.com/)

<br><br>

## üî† Naming guidelines

<br>

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Project

We recommend to name your project the same as the library. This way your git-repo will have the same name as the npm-package.

<br>

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Library

Please name your library as follows `atroposs-yourLibraryName`. The name of the library is later the name of the npm-package.

<br>

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ test-Application

We recommmend to name your application as follows `test-yourLibraryName`.

> Note: In this How-To, we use `yourLibraryname` as synonym for the name of the library. You have to replace it with your own name for your module.

<br><br>

## ‚ñ∂ Generate project

<br>

### Setup project

> Info: Please consider the naming-guidlines mentioned above, when you are creating an module/library for Atroposs.

- Open a Terminal and navigate in your projectfolder.
  Execute `ng new project_name --no-create-application` to generate an empty angular project.
  Within this project we will create our library and our test-application.

- After creating the project open the projectfolder in your IDE

<br><br>

## ‚ñ∂ Generate library

> Info: Please consider the naming-guidlines mentioned above, when you are creating an library for Atroposs.

- Execute `ng generate library atroposs-yourLibraryName` in your angular project to generate the library.

- If you want to use assets (images, fonts, etc.) in your module, than create the folder `assets` under `projects/atroposs-yourLibraryName/`.

  Add the following code to `projects/atroposs-yourLibraryName/ng-package.json`:

  ```
  "assets": ["./assets/"],
  ```

- Navigate to `projects/atroposs-yourLibraryName/src/lib/atroposs-yourLibraryName.component.ts` and delete `lib-` from `selector`.

- Now you are done with the library and you can start to generate your own angular components, modules and services in this library. More about those angular instructions you can find in `projects/atroposs-yourLibraryName/README.md`.

<br><br>

## ‚ñ∂ Generate test-application

> Info: Please consider the naming-guidlines mentioned above, when you are creating an test-application for your Atroposs library.

- Execute `ng generate application test-yourLibraryName` in your angular project to generate the application.

  > Note: `Angular routing = yes` and `Stylesheets = scss`.

- Navigate to `projects/test-yourLibraryName/src/app/app.component.html` and delete everything except for `<router-outlet></router-outlet>` and add `<atroposs-yourLibraryName></atroposs-yourLibraryName>`.
  <br/>It should look like this:
  `  <atroposs-yourLibraryName></atroposs-yourLibraryName>
<router-outlet></router-outlet>`

            > Note:
            <br/>As an alternative you could add `{path: '', component: YourLibraryNameModuleComponent}` to `const routes` in `projects/test-yourLibraryName/src/app/app-routing.module.ts`.
            <br/>Then you would not need to add `<atroposs-yourLibraryName></atroposs-yourLibraryName>` to `projects/test-yourLibraryName/src/app/app.component.html`. Only `<router-outlet></router-outlet>` is needed then.

- Add the following code to `assets` in your `angular.json`:
  > Note: `shorthandle` stands for a short variant of `yourLibraryName`.
  ```
  {
  "glob": "**/*",
  "input": "./projects/atroposs-yourLibraryName/assets",
  "output": "/shorthandle-assets/"
  }
  ```
  - Afterwards it could look like this:
    ```
    "assets": [
        "projects/wasm-application/src/favicon.ico",
        "projects/wasm-application/src/assets",
        {
        "glob": "**/*",
        "input": "./projects/atroposs-yourLibraryName/assets",
        "output": "/shorthandle-assets/"
        }
    ```

<br><br>

## ‚ñ∂ Adding npm scripts

- Add the following code to `scripts` in your `package.json`:

```
"build-lib": "ng build atroposs-yourLibraryName",
"build-app": "ng build test-yourLibraryName",
"pack-lib": "cd dist/atroposs-yourLibraryName/ && npm pack && cd ../..",
"pack-app": "cd dist/test-yourLibraryName/ && npm pack && cd ../..",
"publish-lib": "cd dist/atroposs-yourLibraryName/ && npm publish && cd ../..",
"publish-app": "cd dist/test-yourLibraryName/ && npm publish && cd ../..",
"pack-atroposs-module": "npm run build-lib && npm run pack-lib",
"publish-atroposs-module": "npm run build-lib && npm run pack-lib && npm publish-lib",
```

<br><br>

## ‚ñ∂ Dev: Test if it works :)

- Run `npm start`. If you see `yourLibraryName works!`, than your library is successfully connected to your test application.
- Now you can work within your library and you can see/test your changes by running `npm start`.

<br><br>

## ‚ñ∂ Pack & Publish your library

> you need an [npmjs.org](npmjs.org) account for this.

- When you added the scripts from `Adding npm scripts` you only need to run `npm run publish-atroposs-module` to publish your module to [npmjs.org](npmjs.org).
- If you did not, then you need to run the following commands.
  1. `npm build`
  2. `cd dist/yourLibraryName/`
  3. `npm pack`
     > Note: You can skip the next step if you just want to pack your module
  4. `npm publish`
  5. `cd ../..`

> NOTE: When you try to publish for the first time you maybe need to log in with your npmjs.org-account. So please watch the terminal while publishing

<br><br>

## Integrate library in Atroposs application

- For now ask [LersCode](https://github.com/LersCode) to do that. You can write him via [mail](mailto:lars.boss@prodyna.com).

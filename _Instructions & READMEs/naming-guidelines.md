# Naming guidelines

> Note: In this How-To, we use `yourLibraryname` as synonym for the name of the library. You have to replace it with your own name for your module.

## 1️⃣ Project

We recommend to name your project the same as the library. This way your git-repo will have the same name as the npm-package.

## 2️⃣ Library

Please name your library as follows `atroposs-yourLibraryName-module`. The name of the library is later the name of the npm-package.
